# Lisper

A common lisp implementation in rust.

*This is just a hobby project. Don't expect to be finished soon.*

## TODO

    * Parser
        [ ] Rewrite the parser so it supports proper syntax errors.
    * Interpreter
        [ ] Function/variable dose not exist error.
        [ ] Scope variables and functions.
        [ ] Exception handling.
